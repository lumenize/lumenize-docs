Lumenize uses a flavor of [relationship-based access control (ReBAC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relationship-based_access_control), also known as graph-based access control (GBAC). While ReBAC may be unfamiliar, it's ideal for modern enterprise software.

## Why ReBAC?

Traditional role-based access control (RBAC) struggles with complex organizational relationships. ReBAC excels at modeling:

- Teams that work across multiple departments
- Temporary projects borrowing resources from various units
- Coaches or consultants who need visibility across organizational boundaries
- Matrix organizations with multiple reporting structures

## The Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)

The OrgTree uses a DAG structure where each node can have multiple parents, unlike traditional single-parent hierarchies.

### Real-World Example

Consider a security team that:
- Officially reports to the IT department
- Does most of its work for the Legal department  
- Provides services to the entire organization

In a DAG, this team can have multiple parents:
- IT Department (official reporting)
- Legal Department (primary work relationship)
- Enterprise Services (organization-wide visibility)

Each relationship can grant different permission levels based on the context.

## Permission Inheritance

Permissions flow down the graph:
- Grant `read` permission on IT Department → Security team inherits `read`
- Grant `write` permission on Legal Department → Security team inherits `write`
- Grant `admin` permission on Enterprise Services → Security team inherits `admin`

The user gets the **highest** permission level from any path in the graph.

## Permission Levels

### Read Permission
- View node values and attached entities
- Navigate the organizational structure
- Access custom fields added to schemas

### Write Permission
- All `read` capabilities, plus:
- Modify node and entity values
- Create new entities attached to the node or descendants
- Soft delete/restore entities
- Add additional parent relationships (with `write` on new parent)

### Admin Permission
- All `write` capabilities, plus:
- Update permissions for the node and descendants
- Manage organizational structure

## Visibility Rules

**Public information** (visible to everyone):
- OrgTree structure itself
- Base schema fields (id, slug, name)

**Protected information** (requires permissions):
- Custom schema fields
- Attached entities
- Business data

This allows navigation without exposing sensitive information.

## Advanced Use Cases

### Rollup Reporting

Create temporary organizational groupings for analysis:
1. Create node "High Performers"
2. Add top teams as additional children
3. Generate comparative reports
4. Remove grouping when analysis complete

### Peer Group Benchmarking

Enable competitive analysis without exposing raw data:
1. Create challenge group with participating teams
2. Teams see their percentile ranking within the group
3. Individual team metrics remain private
4. Temporary structure dissolves after challenge

### Cross-Functional Projects

Model complex project relationships:
1. Create project node
2. Add team members from various departments as children
3. Project manager gets `admin` on project node
4. Stakeholders get appropriate `read`/`write` permissions

## Implementation Benefits

- **Flexibility**: Model complex real-world relationships
- **Security**: Granular, inherited permissions
- **Scalability**: Efficient permission checking
- **Auditability**: Clear permission paths
- **Maintainability**: Change structure without rebuilding permissions
