# Overview

Lumenize is a powerful backend system that combines foundational concepts with cutting-edge features to create a flexible, scalable platform built for modern enterprise applications.

## Core Concepts

Lumenize is built around several key concepts that work together to provide a comprehensive backend solution.

### The OrgTree

The core data structure of every Lumenize server instance is the **OrgTree** - a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with a single root node representing your organization.

Key characteristics:
- **Single root**: The root node represents the organization (e.g., IBM or DHS)
- **Hierarchical structure**: Primary children are divisions, departments, teams, and other organizational units
- **Multiple parents**: Unlike traditional trees, nodes can have multiple parents
- **Extensible**: Add custom fields to org unit schemas to fit your needs

### Entities and Schemas

Everything in Lumenize is an **entity** - a data object with:
- A defined schema
- A unique identifier (UUIDv4)
- Attachment to the OrgTree (directly or indirectly)

#### OrgNode Schema

Default OrgTree node fields:
- `id`: Unique UUIDv4 identifier
- `slug`: Unique string slug within the OrgTree
- `name`: Human-readable name
- `children`: Object mapping child node IDs to relationship metadata

You can extend nodes with custom schemas while preserving core functionality.

### Temporal Data Model

Lumenize maintains complete history using **valid time** semantics:

- **Snapshots**: Immutable versions of entities at specific points in time
- **Time periods**: Each snapshot has `validFrom` (inclusive) and `validTo` (exclusive) timestamps
- **Continuous timeline**: No gaps between snapshots
- **Built for Temporal API**: Designed around JavaScript's upcoming Temporal API

## Database Capabilities

### Multi-Paradigm Data Store

**Document DB + Relational DB + Realtime DB + Temporal DB + ORM**

- **Document DB behavior**: MongoDB-like query language using SQLite's JSON support
- **Relational DB behavior**: Specify fields for indexing, uniqueness, and foreign keys  
- **Realtime DB behavior**: Pub-sub over WebSockets for live updates
- **Temporal DB behavior**: Queryable history of all changes maintained automatically
- **ORM behavior**: Schema enforcement and validation

## API Interfaces

### Model Context Protocol (MCP) Support

- **Automatic tool exposure**: All public DO class methods become MCP tools
- **Resource access**: All entities exposed as MCP resources
- **HTTP stream support**: (Coming soon)
- **Full MCP compliance**: Complete tools and resources spec with subscribe/unsubscribe (Coming soon)

### Cloudflare Native RPC

- **Seamless integration**: Your DO class methods are automatically available as RPC
- **Built-in MCP methods**: Access MCP functionality via native RPC (e.g., `stub['tools/subtract'](42, 23)`)
- **Convenient aliases**: Snake_case alternatives (e.g., `stub.tools_subtract(42, 23)`)

### JSON-RPC 2.0

- **Full spec compliance**: Batches, notifications, errors, named/positional parameters
- **Method exposure**: All public DO class methods automatically available
- **Entity operations**: Built-in get, upsert, delete methods for all entities
- **Multi-transport**: HTTP and WebSockets (unlike Cloudflare native RPC)
- **Real-time subscriptions**: Subscribe to entity updates via WebSockets

## Client Libraries

### Reactive Clients

- **Svelte support**: `useLumenize()` hook with automatic reactivity
- **React support**: (Coming soon)
- **WebSocket multiplexing**: Shared connections across browser tabs via SharedWorker
- **Storage-based reactivity**: localStorage/StorageEvent core for custom implementations

### Generic Client

- **Universal compatibility**: Non-reactive LumenizeClient for any JavaScript/TypeScript environment
- **Simple API**: Clean interface for all Lumenize operations
- **Flexible transport**: HTTP and WebSocket support

## Security & Access Control

### Built-in ReBAC

- **Relationship-based**: Superset of traditional RBAC
- **Graph-based permissions**: Complex organizational modeling
- **Inheritance**: Permissions flow through organizational structure
- **Granular control**: Read, write, and admin permission levels

## Advanced Features

### Aggregations (Coming Soon)

- **Proven OLAP engine**: Based on Lumenize library used by Broadcom, BMW, CA
- **Rollup reporting**: Automatic aggregation across organizational hierarchies  
- **Peer-group benchmarking**: Compare performance within organizational groupings
- **Real-time charts**: Auto-updating visualizations via declarative configuration
- **AMCharts integration**: Built-in support with more chart libraries coming

### Time-Series Support

- **Temporal API integration**: Built around JavaScript's upcoming Temporal API
- **Rich date/time handling**: Time zones, durations, and complex temporal operations
- **Valid time semantics**: Complete audit trail with queryable history

## Platform Integration

### Cloudflare Ecosystem

- **Durable Objects**: Built specifically for Cloudflare's paradigm
- **Workers integration**: Seamless deployment and scaling
- **Edge optimization**: Global distribution and low latency
- **Ecosystem compatibility**: Works with Queues, Workflows, LLMs, KV, R2

## Why These Concepts Matter

These foundational concepts and features enable:
- **Flexible organizational modeling** through DAG structure
- **Comprehensive access control** via ReBAC
- **Complete audit trails** through temporal data
- **Scalable architecture** leveraging Cloudflare's platform
- **Modern API interfaces** with real-time capabilities
- **Rich client library ecosystem** for reactive applications
