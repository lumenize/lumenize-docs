# Core Concepts

Lumenize is built around several key concepts that work together to provide a powerful, flexible backend system.

## The OrgTree

The core data structure of every Lumenize server instance is the **OrgTree** - a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with a single root node representing your organization.

Key characteristics:
- **Single root**: The root node represents the organization (e.g., IBM or DHS)
- **Hierarchical structure**: Primary children are divisions, departments, teams, and other organizational units
- **Multiple parents**: Unlike traditional trees, nodes can have multiple parents
- **Extensible**: Add custom fields to org unit schemas to fit your needs

## Entities and Schemas

Everything in Lumenize is an **entity** - a data object with:
- A defined schema
- A unique identifier (UUIDv4)
- Attachment to the OrgTree (directly or indirectly)

### OrgNode Schema

Default OrgTree node fields:
- `id`: Unique UUIDv4 identifier
- `slug`: Unique string slug within the OrgTree
- `name`: Human-readable name
- `children`: Object mapping child node IDs to relationship metadata

You can extend nodes with custom schemas while preserving core functionality.

## Access Control (ReBAC)

Lumenize uses **Relationship-based Access Control (ReBAC)**, also known as graph-based access control (GBAC).

### Permission Levels

Permissions are cumulative and inherited:

- **`read`**: Access to node values and attached entities
- **`write`**: Modify values, create entities, soft delete/restore, add parents
- **`admin`**: Update permissions for the node and descendants

### Inheritance

Permissions granted on a node are automatically inherited by all descendant nodes, enabling flexible access patterns across complex organizational structures.

## Temporal Data Model

Lumenize maintains complete history using **valid time** semantics:

- **Snapshots**: Immutable versions of entities at specific points in time
- **Time periods**: Each snapshot has `validFrom` (inclusive) and `validTo` (exclusive) timestamps
- **Continuous timeline**: No gaps between snapshots
- **Built for Temporal API**: Designed around JavaScript's upcoming Temporal API

## Why These Concepts Matter

These foundational concepts enable:
- **Flexible organizational modeling** through DAG structure
- **Comprehensive access control** via ReBAC
- **Complete audit trails** through temporal data
- **Scalable architecture** leveraging Cloudflare's platform
