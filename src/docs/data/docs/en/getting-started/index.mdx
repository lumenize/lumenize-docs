# Lumenize
_You provide the schemas. Lumenize provides a complete MCP-first backend._

Lumenize turns your schemas into a full featured MCP-first backend with Access Control, tools/resources/subscribe, CRUD, JSON-RPC, Cloudflare native RPC, Realtime pub-sub over WebSockets, Aggregations, Svelte/React support, and more.

## The Problem

Cloudflare's Durable Objects (DO) are a paradigm shift in how we think about building applications. An SQLite database per DO instance, the ability to write stored procedures in Java/TypeScript, hibernatable WebSockets, and an elegant RPC implementation are all novel if not completely unique. Add to that the rest of the robust distributed computing foundations that Cloudflare provides -- Queues, Workflows, LLMs, KV, R2, etc. -- and you have a powerful platform for building modern applications.

However, paradigm shifts are hard. We are limited by our prior experiences and try to graft concepts and patterns onto a platform where they don't always sit comfortably.

## The Solution

What if we built a backend that was designed from the ground up to take advantage of the DO paradigm and the Cloudflare platform?

That's the goal of Lumenize.

## When to Use Lumenize

Use Lumenize instead of Cloudflare's MCP and Agent offerings when:
- You want to get up and running as quickly as possible with a full backend rather than piece together a bespoke solution
- You want state synchronization but you've hit Agent's state synchronization limitations (no SQL data support, all or nothing updates, etc.)
- You are building a product that requires comprehensive backend functionality out of the box

Use Cloudflare's MCP or Agent offerings instead when:
- You have an existing Cloudflare solution but want to simply add MCP or Agent capabilities to it
- You can't live with the design choices of this backend (the biggest objection will likely be the use of ReBAC)
