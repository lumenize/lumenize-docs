# Deployment

Lumenize makes deployment effortless. Your backend automatically deploys to Cloudflare's global edge network, providing low-latency access worldwide.

## Automatic Deployment

Every time you save a schema, Lumenize automatically:

1. **Validates** your schema changes
2. **Generates** optimized API endpoints
3. **Deploys** to Cloudflare's edge network
4. **Updates** your client SDKs

No build steps, no server management, no deployment pipelines to configure.

## Environments

Lumenize provides multiple environments for safe development:

### Development Environment

- **Purpose**: Local development and testing
- **URL**: `https://dev-api.lumenize.dev/v1/{projectId}`
- **Features**: 
  - Instant schema updates
  - Detailed error messages
  - Development-only debugging tools

### Staging Environment  

- **Purpose**: Pre-production testing
- **URL**: `https://staging-api.lumenize.dev/v1/{projectId}`
- **Features**:
  - Production-like environment
  - Safe testing of schema migrations
  - Performance monitoring

### Production Environment

- **Purpose**: Live applications
- **URL**: `https://api.lumenize.dev/v1/{projectId}`
- **Features**:
  - 99.9% uptime SLA
  - Global edge deployment
  - Advanced monitoring and alerts

## Deployment Process

### 1. Schema Validation

Before deployment, Lumenize validates:

- **Syntax**: Valid JSON schema format
- **Compatibility**: Changes don't break existing data
- **Performance**: Indexes and queries are optimized
- **Security**: Permissions are properly configured

### 2. Migration Planning

For schema changes, Lumenize automatically:

- Analyzes data impact
- Creates migration scripts
- Plans zero-downtime updates
- Validates backward compatibility

### 3. Edge Deployment

Your backend deploys to 200+ edge locations:

```
✅ North America (25 locations)
✅ Europe (35 locations)  
✅ Asia Pacific (40 locations)
✅ South America (8 locations)
✅ Africa (5 locations)
✅ Middle East (12 locations)
```

### 4. Verification

Post-deployment checks ensure:

- All endpoints are responding
- Data integrity is maintained
- Performance meets SLA requirements
- Real-time subscriptions are working

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Configure your deployment with environment variables:

```bash
# API Configuration
LUMENIZE_PROJECT_ID=proj_abc123
LUMENIZE_API_KEY=lum_live_xyz789
LUMENIZE_ENVIRONMENT=production

# Feature Flags
LUMENIZE_ENABLE_ANALYTICS=true
LUMENIZE_ENABLE_RATE_LIMITING=true
LUMENIZE_ENABLE_CACHING=true

# Security
LUMENIZE_CORS_ORIGINS=https://myapp.com,https://admin.myapp.com
LUMENIZE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=wh_secret_123
```

### Custom Domains

Use your own domain for API endpoints:

1. **Add domain** in project settings
2. **Configure DNS** with provided CNAME
3. **Verify domain** ownership
4. **Deploy** automatically updates

```bash
# Before
https://api.lumenize.dev/v1/proj_abc123/users

# After  
https://api.myapp.com/v1/users
```

### SSL Certificates

Lumenize automatically provisions and manages SSL certificates:

- **Automatic renewal** before expiration
- **Global edge termination** for fast SSL handshakes
- **TLS 1.3 support** for maximum security
- **HSTS headers** enabled by default

## Monitoring

### Deployment Status

Track deployment progress in real-time:

```bash
# Via CLI
lumenize deploy status

# Via Dashboard
https://app.lumenize.dev/projects/{id}/deployments
```

### Health Checks

Automatic health monitoring includes:

- **API response times** across all regions
- **Error rates** and failure patterns
- **Database performance** and query times
- **WebSocket connection** health

### Alerts

Get notified of issues:

- **Email alerts** for deployment failures
- **Slack integration** for team notifications
- **Webhook alerts** for custom integrations
- **SMS alerts** for critical issues (Enterprise)

## Rollbacks

Instant rollback capabilities:

### Automatic Rollbacks

Triggered when:
- Error rate exceeds 5%
- Response time increases >100%
- Health checks fail consistently

### Manual Rollbacks

```bash
# Via CLI
lumenize rollback --version 1.2.3

# Via Dashboard
Click "Rollback" on any previous deployment
```

### Rollback Process

1. **Instant cutover** to previous version
2. **Data consistency** maintained
3. **Client connections** seamlessly redirected
4. **Zero downtime** guaranteed

## Performance Optimization

### Global Edge Caching

- **Schema definitions** cached at edge
- **Query results** cached based on rules
- **Static assets** served from nearest location
- **API responses** cached for configured TTL

### Database Optimization

- **Automatic indexing** based on query patterns
- **Connection pooling** for efficient resource use
- **Query optimization** suggestions in dashboard
- **Performance analytics** and recommendations

## Security

### Deployment Security

- **Signed deployments** prevent tampering
- **Encrypted data** in transit and at rest
- **Access controls** limit who can deploy
- **Audit logs** track all deployment activity

### Runtime Security

- **DDoS protection** at Cloudflare edge
- **Rate limiting** prevents abuse
- **WAF rules** block malicious requests
- **IP allowlisting** for sensitive operations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Deployment Stuck**
```bash
# Check deployment status
lumenize deploy status --verbose

# Force restart deployment
lumenize deploy retry
```

**Schema Validation Errors**
```bash
# Validate schema locally
lumenize schema validate ./schema.json

# Get detailed error info
lumenize deploy logs --deployment-id dep_123
```

**Performance Issues**
```bash
# Check regional performance
lumenize performance --region us-east-1

# Analyze slow queries
lumenize analyze queries --slow
```
